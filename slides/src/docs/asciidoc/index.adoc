Significant cultural events in 1982

Brave New World, the only single from Toyah's The Changeling LP. That's long player for you young people. 

We could think about the Falklands Conflict, the opening of the Hacienda club, the launch of the Hyundai Pony - the first Korean car to be sold in Britain, Bobby Robson taking the England Manager job - bringing a crushing end to Ipswich Town's brief few years a proper top flight club, or even the publication of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4s

The big beast though, the big launch, was this thing, the ZX Spectrum. Available in a 16k or 48k model, yours for a £125 or £175 respectively.

So what happens is your Dad inherits some money from his maiden aunt and, in an uncharacteristic fit of generosity, lets his three children buy some a big fancy. My recollection is I got a new bike, my brother Ric got a 12 inch tv - black and white CRT fans!, and it was my youngest brother Ali who wanted a computer, but he would only have been 6 so I think I'm getting that wrong. Anyway, my Dad sent away the mail order coupon and after many weeks of manufacturing delay, this box is delivered, we all gather round to unpack it and plug it into the big colour tv in the lounge and ...
