Retro game nonsense

### Thanks

I've been thinking about writing some kind of little games for years. Back in 2016, I actually 
created a repository, but only ever got as far creating a README. I've finally been spurred into 
action by [https://ronjeffries.com/categories/asteroids/](Ron Jeffries' lovely series of 
articles describing his journey writing a version of Asteroids for iPads using Codea). 
They just full of coding joy, so many thanks go to him.

Thanks also to [http://www.minotaurproject.co.uk/](Jeff Minter). I've been a fan of his since I was, 
what 14 or 15 years old, and his work continues to be a joy. If I can capture a tiny, tiny part 
of what makes his work so wonderful, well, that'd just be fantastic.
